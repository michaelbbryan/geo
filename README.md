# geo

This repository keeps the environments, tools and examples of geographic data access.
Like the repository name, it expects a python environment called geotools that reflects
the requirements.txt or environment.yml files included here.

Demonstration programs use the geopandas geodatabases in by the US Census TIGER/Line
publication. https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2021/
