# pyenvironments
The folders in this repository hold the files for recreating python virtual environments.
As python environments get very large, the number of dependencies and version conflicts grows
unmanageably.  These environments provide a baseline and sample code for new projects.

The file gen.bat contains the commands to loop over these environments, generating the
requirements.txt and environment.yml file for each.

Each folder has its own README.md file and potentially different LICENSE text.
